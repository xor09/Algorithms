GUIDE TO COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING:

-by Striver (Software Engineer(Media.net), ex-Amazon, Candidate Master, 6*, Educator at Unacademy)

It's advice to switch to CPP to avoid TLE issues at Codeforces and some platforms..
Learn C++ STL from codeverse or takeUforward channel ..

Follow CP sheet for practice problems:
CP SHEET: https://bit.ly/tuf_CPList 
SDE SHEET: https://bit.ly/takeUforward_SDE 

1.Pattern printing problems (Sourabh Shukla Videos on Youtube)

2.time complexity analysis (Don’t stress to much, keep participating in contests, you will keep learning)

3.linear search and circular array representation (any article, no need to practice)

4.palindrome and other numbers(perfect, Armstrong) for basic number problems

5.Simple Hashing Problem(frequency counting and stuffs)

6.Prefix Sum Problems(1D and 2D) {CP Sheet has problems}

7.Sliding window technique(CP Sheet has problems) -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basics of number theory

1.Binary Search (TakeUforward Playlist and CP Sheet practice problems)

2. GCD of 2 numbers in logarithmic time(Euclidean and Extended Euclidean Algorithm) (CodeNCode)

3.linear Diphantine Equation (CodeNCode)

4. Checking prime in sqrt(n) complexity (Learn from Codeverse Channel)

6.Segmented Sieve (Learn from Codeverse Channel)

7.Finding prime factorisation of a number in logn per querry (Learn from Codeverse Channel)

8.Euler Totent Function (CodeNcode)

7.Inclusion Exclusion Principle (combinatorics problems)


1.learn about basic sorting algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion)
2. do problems which are constructive and have a lot of swapping terms in it.
3.solve problems related to two pointer approach. (TakeUforward playlist)
4.Bit manipulation(left shift, right shift, xor, or, and,set bit,MSB, LSB etc..) (Codeverse)

5.Power set of a given array or string using BIT (TakeUforward has a lecture)
6.Number of subarrays with XOR as zero(not an algorithm but a must do problem) (TakeUforward)
7. Problems related to greedy algorithm (TakeUforward Playlist)
8.Kadane's algorithm (TakeUforward) and problems related to them

Time to learn recursion (Codeverse 3 masterclasses by Striver and TakeUforward Playlist)

After Recursion:
1. Meet in the middle algorithm and problems related to it. (Follow CSES for problems)
2.Divide and conquer problems{highly recommended to use codeforces only for this}
3. Next greater element and next smaller element using stack (TakeUforward)
4. problems related to parenthesis.
5.largest rectangular area in histogram. (concept is used in a lot of problems) (TakeUforward)
6.Problems related to Heap(Priority Queue) {although this gets under the greedy category but by priority queue will help you learn an inbuilt stl)

String algorithms: (Since these are advanced topics, you can read them from where you feel comfortable)

1. Rolling Hash Function on strings {cpalgorithms has a wonderful article written on it) {Spoj or codeforces}
2.Rabin Karp Algorithm (cpalgorithms has a wonderful blog on it)

Tree Algorithm :

1.Tree/Graph representation
2.DFS/BFS Traversal in Graph/Tree
3.Basic stuffs(diameter of tree, height of tree, level of tree)
